    "I looked up at the many tall buildings. This would be my final stop before the capital. For a moment I wondered why I was going to the capital in the first place. But then I remembered that my sensei once had said in a drunken haze, that it was where my parents grew up. So I wanted to see this capital for myself."
    "This city seemed a lot larger than the two previous I had visited."
    "As I walked up to a school bike parking place, I felt something tugging in my clothes from behind."
    unknown "Excuse me, sirmissperson?"
    "I turned around to see a small raccoon girl, tugging at my shirt. crouching down to be at eyeheight with her, I tilted my head to the side."

    "She smiled at me."
    unknown "Hello! Uhh, my name is NAME. Would you mind, uhhmm, helping me with something?"

    me "I wouldn't say so, no."
    "The raccoon suddenly seemed quite gloomy."
    raccoon "I think you're a bad person... My parents have taught me what happens to bad people..."

    raccoon "BODYGUARD! Show this person what happens to meanies!"
    "A large shape approached from the shadows."
    me "Whoa, wait a minute, I didn't do anything!"
    "The shape simply grunted, as it pulled out a chainsaw."
    me "Please?..."
    "I was about to run away, when I suddenly found that I couldn't feel my feet anymore.{w}.......{w} In fact, I couldn't feel my entire body."

    raccoon "I need some help with my school assignment about webdesign! My parents care a lot about my grades, and they can get {i}very{/i} mad."
    "I raised an eyebrow. I really didn't want to spend my time on teaching a little girl webdesign, but if her parents were going to get mad... It couldn't be helped."
    me "I suppose I could help you a bit. Would you mind telling me a bit more about your project?"
    "She looked around, scanning the area for anyone that might be listening in."

    "She grabbed my shirt again, dragging me along."

    "We went through a side-entrance to the school building, and up a flight of stairs, before we came to a brightly lit corridor. Several students were wandering around, talking to eachother. {w}Some seemed to send me weary glances, probably because I didn't look like anyone belonging to this school"
    "A shadow drew my attention on the far end of the hallway. As soon as I looked at it, however, it dissapeared."
    scene school roof
    "We soon got to the roof of the building. I immediately noticed that it was completely empty. But not only that; it was also completely open, with few places to hide. It also had benches to sit on."
    raccoon "Let's, uhhm, sit over here!"
    "I followed her to the nearest bench."
    raccoon "So, uhh, sirmissperson. Do you..."
    "As her voice turned to a whisper, I leaned in closer."
    raccoon "Do you... Believe in dragons?"
    "Before I could reply, she raised a hand to silence me."
    raccoon "No, let me speak first."
    "Seeing that I did not object, she continued."
    raccoon "Well... I wanted to make my website about how dragons exist, and, uhhmm, how we can be friends with them..."

    "A sign saying \"Caution! - Floor slippery when wet\" was placed outside the toilets."
    "Just as I was about to run through the doorway, I felt my feet lose their grip on the floor."

    raccoon "The dragon! She was here last time I looked..."
    "Walking a bit further along the beach, we saw four large footprints in the sand, with something akin to clawmarks, having bored deep into the ground. It would seem that whatever left these footprints had taken off."
